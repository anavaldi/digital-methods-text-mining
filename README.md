# Digital Methods for Analysing Texts

This course familiarises PhD students with the main **text mining** techniques in social science and develops
basic skills in digital methods. After completion you are familiar with the theoretical and methodological
underpinnings of natural language processing perspective and are able to conduct a basic text analysis.
Throughout the course we will focus on applying text analysis to empirical data, where possible related to
the students own research.

Students will become familiar with **digital methods in text analysis** as a flexible approach that comes with
a practical set of research instruments to empirically investigate a range of questions in social science. They
will learn how to approach and **manage text data, analyse texts, and visualize** this information.
