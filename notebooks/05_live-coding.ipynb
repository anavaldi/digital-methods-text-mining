      "2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Iran, and was born on 22nd July 1996.\n",
      "He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 24th April 2018\n",
      "refusing his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection pursuant to\n",
      "paragraph 339C of HC 395.\n",
      "The Appellant‚Äôs Claim\n",
      "3. The essence of the Appellant‚Äôs claim is that he is a member of a particular\n",
      "social group, because he is a gay Iranian man who would face persecution\n",
      "if returned, and additionally he is also an atheist, who would be ill-treated\n",
      "upon return as a non-religious person, which is forbidden in Iran.  \n",
      "The Judge‚Äôs Findings\n",
      "4. The judge noted how the Appellant in his screening interview has said that\n",
      "he held no religion and that he would be subject to persecution as a non-\n",
      "religious person if returned to Iran.  He made no mention at that stage\n",
      "that he was also a gay person.  During his asylum interview, however, he\n",
      "stated that he was a danger also because he was a homosexual and\n",
      "feared the government given that homosexuality was punishable by\n",
      "death.  He had not mentioned this at his screening interview because he\n",
      "did not know anything about the country he was coming to.  The Appellant\n",
      "had then explained how he had a boyfriend in the UK by the name of [FS],\n",
      "with whom he had been in relationship for about one and a half months.\n",
      "He also had three serious relationships which he went on to describe in\n",
      "evidence before the Tribunal.  The judge did not find the Appellant to be\n",
      "credible because the appellant‚Äôs explanation that he had not mentioned\n",
      "his homosexuality during his screening interview, because he did not know\n",
      "the country he was coming to, was not plausible.  As the judge explained,\n",
      "‚Äúif he did not know the UK approach to homosexuality ‚Ä¶ he could not\n",
      "have known if the UK adopted as punitive an approach to gay people as\n",
      "did Iran‚Ä¶.  For all he knew he could have been travelling from the frying\n",
      "pan into the fire‚Äù (paragraph 68).  \n",
      "5. On the other hand, the judge observed that if the Appellant was aware of\n",
      "the actual UK approach to homosexuality, ‚Äúthen there was no reason for\n",
      "him not to have mentioned his sexuality at the screening interview‚Äù\n",
      "(paragraph 69).  \n",
      "6. The judge was also not impressed by the witnesses before the Tribunal.  In\n",
      "short, the Appellant‚Äôs claim was rejected wholesale.   The appeal was\n",
      "dismissed.\n",
      "Grounds of Application\n",
      "7. The grounds of application state that the judge had engaged in a material\n",
      "error of law in relation to the evidence of a Miss [L] and that of Mr [S]\n",
      "whose credibility had been wrongly impugned by the judge.  There had\n",
      "been apparently a discrepancy between to the oral and the written\n",
      "2\n",
      "Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018\n",
      "evidence of Miss [L], but this discrepancy had not been put to the witness,\n",
      "and if this was so then this was contrary to the rules of natural justice.  \n",
      "8. On 23rd November 2018 permission to appeal was granted.  \n",
      "Submissions\n",
      "9. At the hearing before me on 5th July 2019, the Appellant was represented\n",
      "by Mr Howard, who adopted the grounds of application.  He submitted that\n",
      "if the judge was concerned about the discrepancy in the oral and written\n",
      "evidence of Miss [L], then this should have been explored by the Tribunal,\n",
      "because in her oral evidence, Miss [L] had said that she had ‚Äúnot met [F]‚Äù,\n",
      "whereas in her written evidence she had said that ‚Äúshe also knew his\n",
      "previous partner, [F]‚Äù (paragraph 34).  Secondly, Mr Howard submitted\n",
      "that if one looks at the evidence of Mr [S] (at page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs\n",

      "organisation called Persian LGBT Advisory Services, where it provides\n",
      "‚Äúvoluntary social activities for LGBT asylum seekers‚Äù.  He explains that the\n",
      "appellant had contacted him via Facebook on 9th June 2016.  He invited\n",
      "the Appellant to meet with him, and after a conversation he had come to\n",
      "the view that ‚ÄúI am aware the Appellant is openly active on Facebook page\n",
      "which I would refer to as an online activist where he shares information on\n",
      "LGBT community using his Facebook page‚Ä¶‚Äù.   On that basis that the\n",
      "judge was wrong to have impugned his credibility. \n",
      "10. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that the issues that were before the judge,\n",
      "both in relation to the Appellant‚Äôs atheism and his homosexual tendencies,\n",
      "were not new issues.  If evidence was collected by the Appellant between\n",
      "the asylum interview and the Tribunal hearing, in a manner that the\n",
      "Appellant himself chose to do, then he should have been prepared to deal\n",
      "with it on the basis of oral testimony.  These were not new points.  The\n",
      "witnesses were not people whose evidence had previously been accepted.\n",
      "Both cases were simply black and white discrepancy cases where the\n",
      "judge was entitled to say that she would not attach any significant weight\n",
      "to such evidence, because as put before the Tribunal, the evidence was\n",
      "not persuasive.  \n",
      "No Error of Law\n",
      "11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did not involve\n",
      "the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007)\n",
      "such that I should set aside the decision.  My reasons are as follows.  First,\n",
      "it is simply not correct to say that the discrepancy in the oral and witness\n",
      "statement evidence of Miss [L] was something that the judge should have\n",
      "probed herself with a view to ascertaining exactly what Miss [L] knew\n",
      "about Mr [F].  The judge noted that in her oral evidence Miss [L] stated she\n",
      "was aware that the Appellant had a relationship in the UK ‚Äúbut had not\n",
      "met [F]‚Äù.  Then the judge noted how in her witness statement, Miss [L] had\n",
