       "'Upper Tribunal\\n(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)\\nAppeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\nTHE IMMIGRATION ACTS\\nHeard at Birmingham CJC\\nDecision\\n&\\nReasons\\nPromulgated\\nOn 21 November 2019\\nOn 8 November 2019\\nBefore\\nDEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE O‚ÄôRYAN\\nBetween\\nMR D A\\n(ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)\\nAppellant\\nand\\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT\\nRespondent\\nRepresentation:\\nFor the Appellant:\\nMr Sharif, Fountain Solicitors\\nFor the Respondent: Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer\\nDECISION AND REASONS\\n1.\\nThis is the Appellant‚Äôs appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier\\nTribunal Boylan-Kemp MBE dated 2 May 2019 dismissing the Appellant‚Äôs\\nappeal against the Respondent‚Äôs decision of 23 November 2018 refusing\\nhis human rights and protection claim.\\n¬© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\n2. The Appellant is a national of Iraq of Kurdish origin and from Sulamaniyah\\nin the IKR. He gave an account that he was at risk of serious harm in the\\nIKR by reason of his family and extended tribe being in a feud with another\\ntribe in the IKR. The Appellant was not able to give many details of the\\norigins of the feud but stated that one family member had been killed as a\\nresult of it and that he himself had experienced two incidents; one being\\nthat unknown persons had fired upon a car in which he was travelling and\\nhis cousin had been injured in the shoulder, and another occasion when\\nthe house in which he lived was fired upon.\\n3. The Respondent in its decision refusing the protection claim disbelieved\\nthe Appellant‚Äôs account that there was any feud on the grounds that the\\nAppellant knew very few details of the alleged feud. There was also said\\nto be a discrepancy as between the Appellant‚Äôs evidence in interview as to\\nhow many occasions the Appellant experienced any problems himself\\n(refusal letter, para [26]) and a discrepancy between an alleged fear of his\\nown father (resulting from the Appellant refusing to take part in the feud)\\nand information given in an age assessment interview in which he had\\nstated that he had a good relationship with his family members (para\\n[31]).\\n4. The Appellant appealed against that decision and the matter came before\\nthe judge at the Birmingham hearing centre on 18 March 2019. The\\nAppellant was represented and gave evidence. At the date of that hearing\\nthe Appellant would have been 18 years of age. A further document was\\nrelied upon by the Respondent at that hearing, being a EURODAC search\\nresult, demonstrating that a person in the Appellant‚Äôs identity was\\nfingerprinted in Dresden in Germany on 22 March 2016. The Appellant‚Äôs\\naccount as given in his SEF interview and confirmed in oral evidence\\nbefore the judge was that he only left Iraq in December 2017. The\\nAppellant denied before the judge that the person identified in the\\nEURODAC search was him but the judge stated that she was satisfied by\\nthe details contained within the document, and looking at the clear\\nphotograph on the EURODAC match, that the person fingerprinted in\\nGermany was indeed the Appellant.\\n5. The judge found at paragraph 14 onwards as follows:\\n‚Äú16. The evidence provided by the EURODAC document is\\nunequivocal. The photograph contained within the document is\\nclearly the Appellant who appeared before me and I have no\\nreason to doubt that the document relates to him. Therefore this\\ndocument upon which I am satisfied I can place significant weight\\nputs him in Germany on 22 March 2016. Consequently I find that\\nthis evidence undermines the credibility of his entire account and\\nhis credibility as a witness in his own cause and that it renders\\nhis entire account unreliable.\\n2Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\n17. Further I also find his inability to recall the details of the alleged\\nfeud which caused him to leave his family and flee the country to\\nalso not be credible. If a young man was leaving his life behind\\nbecause of his reluctance to become involved in an ongoing\\nfamily feud then I would anticipate that he would have\\nknowledge of what he is in fear of and so I do not find it plausible\\nthat he would not know the details of this feud if he held such a\\ngenuine fear. Also I note that even on his own evidence there\\nhas been no specific risk or threat made to him which would\\ncause him to fear for his own safety beyond what is a more\\ngeneral tribal threat and of which he cannot provide much detail.\\n...\\n18. As I have found the Appellant‚Äôs alleged reasoning for leaving Iraq\\nto not be credible then I also find that it is not plausible that his\\nfamily have consequently threatened him as claimed due to his\\nalleged desertion because of the alleged feud. Instead I find that\\nhe has travelled to the UK with the assistance and knowledge of\\nhis family for reasons other than escaping a risk of persecution.\\nAs such I find that his family would therefore be able to assist\\nhim with obtaining a copy of his identification documents and\\nCSID which would help facilitate his return to Iraq. I also find that\\nhe would be able to return to the help and support of his family\\nthere.‚Äù\\nThe judge dismissed the Appellant‚Äôs appeal.\\n6. The Appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal on grounds dated 15 May\\n2019 which argue very briefly that the judge erred in law at paragraphs 15\\nto 20 by giving inadequate reasoning for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account to\\nnot be credible and secondly that the judge had failed to apply relevant\\ncountry guidance.\\n7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Keane\\non 24 June 2019. The judge stated as follows:\\n‚ÄúThe judge arguably had regard to irrelevant considerations in finding\\nthat the Appellant had not given a credible account of events. The\\njudge‚Äôs findings as to the credibility were to be found at paragraphs\\n15 to 18 inclusive of her decision. At paragraph 15 the judge\\nattached weight so as to undermine the Appellant‚Äôs credibility to a\\nEURODAC printout provided by the Respondent which as the judge\\nfound proved that the Appellant was photographed and printed in\\nGermany on 22 March 2016. The judge however did not explain why\\nsuch circumstance damaged the Appellant‚Äôs credibility. If the judge\\nhad in mind the Appellant‚Äôs apparent failure to claim asylum in\\nGermany the judge arguably should have stated so. At paragraph 16\\nof the decision the judge again accorded weight to the EURODAC\\ndocument without stating why. At paragraph 17 of the decision the\\n3Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\njudge stated that the judge would have anticipated that the Appellant\\nwould have had knowledge of the alleged feud which on his case\\ncaused him to leave his family and indeed his country. The judge\\narguably substituted her own understanding of what constituted\\nreasonable conduct in circumstances where arguably she should not\\nhave done so. At paragraph 18 the judge stated that it was not\\nplausible that the Appellant‚Äôs family have consequently threatened\\nhim on account of his ostensible desertion and the judge was\\narguably disbelieving the Appellant‚Äôs account without providing any\\nor adequate reasons. It was incumbent on the judge in resolving the\\nissue of credibility to embark upon a global assessment of the\\nAppellant‚Äôs credibility and to provide adequate reasons in support of a\\nfinding that he had not done so. This the judge arguably failed to do.‚Äù\\nSubmissions\\n8. Mr Sharif relies upon the grounds of appeal and the admittedly more\\nextensive grant of permission to appeal in support of his Appellant‚Äôs case.\\n9. Mr Sharif points out that the only date given in the Appellant‚Äôs account for\\nany particular incident was in relation to the incident when the car in\\nwhich the Appellant was travelling had been shot at. The date for that is to\\nbe found in the SEF interview at [86] and was simply ‚Äò2016‚Äô. The\\nAppellant gives no other dates for the matters that he relies upon in\\nsupport of the proposition that he is at risk because of a blood feud in Iraq.\\nHe does however consistently state that he left Iraq in December 2017.\\nMr Sharif argues that the Appellant had accepted in the course of his\\nevidence that he had travelled through Germany and therefore the\\nevidence from the EURODAC search confirming that did not alter the\\ncredibility of the Appellant‚Äôs account. Mr Sharif also argued that the\\njudge‚Äôs findings in relation to it being incredible that the Appellant would\\nnot have had more knowledge about the details of the feud was an\\nirrational finding on the part of the judge.\\n10. For his part Mr Mills defends the judge‚Äôs decision and argues that the\\ndishonest statement that the Appellant had remained in December 2017\\nwas clearly capable of affecting the credibility of the Appellant‚Äôs account.\\nI raised with him whether or not such a discrepancy could be treated as\\ndeterminative of the account given that there were no dates given in the\\nAppellant‚Äôs account of matters occurring in Iraq any later than 22 March\\n2016. Mr Mills appeared to accept that it was right to say that the\\nAppellant‚Äôs credibility was not determinatively decided by the discrepancy\\nof his whereabouts in March 2016. However Mr Mills points to the other\\nfindings at paragraph 17 in support of the judge‚Äôs reasoning.\\nDiscussion\\n11. I find no material error of law in the judge‚Äôs decision. The suggestion in\\nthe grant of permission to appeal by Judge Keane that the judge had\\n4Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\narguably had regard to irrelevant considerations is difficult to sustain. The\\nAppellant has clearly given inconsistent evidence about his whereabouts,\\non the one part insisting that he remained in Iraq in December 2017 but\\nincontrovertible evidence existing from the EURODAC search result that he\\nwas present in Germany on 22 March 2016. These two items of evidence\\nsimply cannot sit together. True it is that there are no details of the\\nAppellant‚Äôs account of any incidents that he has set out which are dated\\nany later than 22 March 2016, and therefore being shot at in ‚Äò2016‚Äô and\\nhim departing Iraq prior to 22 March 2016 does not necessarily make his\\naccount impossible to believe, but it is clearly a very significant matter\\nthat the Appellant has lied about his continued presence in Iraq up to the\\npoint of December 2017 and the judge was fully entitled to treat that as a\\nvery significant matter. Whether or not she was entitled to treat it as\\nrendering ‚Äòhis entire account unreliable‚Äô is moot.\\n12. However the judge does not stop there in her credibility findings because\\nshe continues, as is clear at paragraph 17, to set out other reasons for\\nfinding the Appellant‚Äôs account incredible. Whereas it may be expected\\nthat a young person may not be as fully informed about the details of a\\nfeud affecting his family and the wider tribe as might a fully-grown adult,\\nthe judge‚Äôs point is that the Appellant decided, together with the\\nassistance of a relative, to leave Iraq because of this feud and the judge\\nwas entitled to find that it was implausible that the Appellant knew so little\\nabout the feud whereas it had been the specific cause of his decision to\\nleave the country. I find that it was not irrational for the judge to make\\nthe findings that she did at paragraph 17. There are a number of reasons\\ntherefore given by the judge for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account incredible\\nand I find that none of those reasons is vitiated by any error of law.\\n13. Judge Keane in granting permission did not comment upon the Appellant‚Äôs\\nactual second ground which was that the judge had failed to apply country\\nguidance relevant to the issue of obtaining documents for readmission and\\nresidence in Iraq. However in the light of my decision that the judge‚Äôs\\ncredibility findings are sustainable it is also sustainable that the Appellant\\ncan have the assistance of family members in Iraq to obtain any\\nreplacement documents that are needed to facilitate his return to, and\\nresidence in Iraq.\\nNotice of Decision\\nThe judge‚Äôs decision did not involve the making of any material error of\\nlaw.\\nI do not set aside the decision.\\nThe Appellant‚Äôs appeal is dismissed.\\nSigned\\nDate 20.11.19\\n5Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\nDeputy Upper Tribunal Judge O‚ÄôRyan\\nDirection Regarding Anonymity ‚Äì Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure\\n(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008\\nUnless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted\\nanonymity.

In the determination, the judge dismissed the appeal of\\nthe Appellant, whereupon the Appellant subsequently applied for, and was\\ngranted, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter\\ncomes before me.\\nThe Appellant\\n¬© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018\\n2.\\nThe Appellant is a male, a citizen of Iran, and was born on 22 nd July 1996.\\nHe appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 24 th April 2018\\nrefusing his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection pursuant to\\nparagraph 339C of HC 395.\\nThe Appellant‚Äôs Claim\\n3.\\nThe essence of the Appellant‚Äôs claim is that he is a member of a particular\\nsocial group, because he is a gay Iranian man who would face persecution\\nif returned, and additionally he is also an atheist, who would be ill-treated\\nupon return as a non-religious person, which is forbidden in Iran.\\nThe Judge‚Äôs Findings\\n4. The judge noted how the Appellant in his screening interview has said that\\nhe held no religion and that he would be subject to persecution as a non-\\nreligious person if returned to Iran. He made no mention at that stage\\nthat he was also a gay person. During his asylum interview, however, he\\nstated that he was a danger also because he was a homosexual and\\nfeared the government given that homosexuality was punishable by\\ndeath. He had not mentioned this at his screening interview because he\\ndid not know anything about the country he was coming to. The Appellant\\nhad then explained how he had a boyfriend in the UK by the name of [FS],\\nwith whom he had been in relationship for about one and a half months.\\nHe also had three serious relationships which he went on to describe in\\nevidence before the Tribunal. The judge did not find the Appellant to be\\ncredible because the appellant‚Äôs explanation that he had not mentioned\\nhis homosexuality during his screening interview, because he did not know\\nthe country he was coming to, was not plausible. As the judge explained,\\n‚Äúif he did not know the UK approach to homosexuality ... he could not\\nhave known if the UK adopted as punitive an approach to gay people as\\ndid Iran.... For all he knew he could have been travelling from the frying\\npan into the fire‚Äù (paragraph 68).\\n5. On the other hand, the judge observed that if the Appellant was aware of\\nthe actual UK approach to homosexuality, ‚Äúthen there was no reason for\\nhim not to have mentioned his sexuality at the screening interview‚Äù\\n(paragraph 69).\\n6. The judge was also not impressed by the witnesses before the Tribunal. In\\nshort, the Appellant‚Äôs claim was rejected wholesale. The appeal was\\ndismissed.\\nGrounds of Application\\n7.\\nThe grounds of application state that the judge had engaged in a material\\nerror of law in relation to the evidence of a Miss [L] and that of Mr [S]\\nwhose credibility had been wrongly impugned by the judge. There had\\nbeen apparently a discrepancy between to the oral and the written\\n2Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018\\nevidence of Miss [L], but this discrepancy had not been put to the witness,\\nand if this was so then this was contrary to the rules of natural justice.\\n8.\\nOn 23 rd November 2018 permission to appeal was granted.\\nSubmissions\\n9.\\nAt the hearing before me on 5 th July 2019, the Appellant was represented\\nby Mr Howard, who adopted the grounds of application. He submitted that\\nif the judge was concerned about the discrepancy in the oral and written\\nevidence of Miss [L], then this should have been explored by the Tribunal,\\nbecause in her oral evidence, Miss [L] had said that she had ‚Äúnot met [F]‚Äù,\\nwhereas in her written evidence she had said that ‚Äúshe also knew his\\nprevious partner, [F]‚Äù (paragraph 34). Secondly, Mr Howard submitted\\nthat if one looks at the evidence of Mr [S] (at page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs\\nbundle). He makes it quite clear that he is the director of a voluntary\\norganisation called Persian LGBT Advisory Services, where it provides\\n‚Äúvoluntary social activities for LGBT asylum seekers‚Äù. He explains that the\\nappellant had contacted him via Facebook on 9 th June 2016. He invited\\nthe Appellant to meet with him, and after a conversation he had come to\\nthe view that ‚ÄúI am aware the Appellant is openly active on Facebook page\\nwhich I would refer to as an online activist where he shares information on\\nLGBT community using his Facebook page...‚Äù. On that basis that the\\njudge was wrong to have impugned his credibility.\\n10. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that the issues that were before the judge,\\nboth in relation to the Appellant‚Äôs atheism and his homosexual tendencies,\\nwere not new issues. If evidence was collected by the Appellant between\\nthe asylum interview and the Tribunal hearing, in a manner that the\\nAppellant himself chose to do, then he should have been prepared to deal\\nwith it on the basis of oral testimony. These were not new points. The\\nwitnesses were not people whose evidence had previously been accepted.\\nBoth cases were simply black and white discrepancy cases where the\\njudge was entitled to say that she would not attach any significant weight\\nto such evidence, because as put before the Tribunal, the evidence was\\nnot persuasive.\\nNo Error of Law\\n11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did not involve\\nthe making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007)\\nsuch that I should set aside the decision. My reasons are as follows. First,\\nit is simply not correct to say that the discrepancy in the oral and witness\\nstatement evidence of Miss [L] was something that the judge should have\\nprobed herself with a view to ascertaining exactly what Miss [L] knew\\nabout Mr [F]. The judge noted that in her oral evidence Miss [L] stated she\\nwas aware that the Appellant had a relationship in the UK ‚Äúbut had not\\nmet [F]‚Äù. Then the judge noted how in her witness statement, Miss [L] had\\nstated that she became friends with the Appellant when she met him in\\nCalais at the ‚Äúthe jungle‚Äù in April 2016, and ‚Äúwhen they became strong\\n3Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018\\nfriends he told her of his fear of persecution and that he was an atheist.\\nShe also knew his previous partner, [F]‚Äù (paragraph 34). It was for the\\nAppellant‚Äôs representative to probe this matter further. As the evidence\\nstood, the judge was entitled to conclude that ‚ÄúMiss [L] has also been\\ninconsistent in a written and oral account of whether she had met [F]‚Äù\\n(paragraph 78).\\n12. Second, as far as Mr [S]‚Äôs evidence is concerned, I note that he is a\\ndirector of the voluntary organisation called Persian LGBT Advisory\\nServices. He wrote in terms that he was ‚Äúaware the Appellant is openly\\nactive on Facebook page‚Äù. He had stated that ‚ÄúI have acknowledged that\\nthe Appellant has made a strong relationship with the wider LGBT\\ncommunities ...‚Äù. He had further stated that ‚ÄúI have also seen that the\\nAppellant has participated openly at this year‚Äôs LGBT Pride with Christian\\nLGBT parade ...‚Äù. He ended his statement by declaring that ‚Äúbased on\\ninformation that has been provided by the Appellant I can confirm that he\\nis homosexual and would be subject of persecution...‚Äù. (See page 14 of\\nthe Appellant‚Äôs bundle). The manner in which the judge dealt with this\\nevidence was one which was entirely open to her to do. What the judge\\nstates is that she would ‚Äúattach very little weight to Mr [S]‚Äôs evidence‚Äù\\nbecause ‚Äúhe said at the hearing that he had attended court since 2008 to\\nsupport gay asylum seekers‚Äù.\\n13. Nevertheless as the judge observed, ‚Äúhis support did not, on his own\\nevidence, comprise independent verification of each Appellant‚Äôs claim\\nsince he took the claim of each at face value, entirely taking their word for\\nit without doing anything to verify their claim, in the way of what might be\\ntermed ‚Äòdue diligence‚Äô. While he may well be well-meaning, the uncritical\\nnature of his support means it is of very little probative value‚Äù (paragraph\\n79).\\n14. There is nothing in this particular analysis of the judge‚Äôs detailed\\nexplanation that sits ill at ease with what the witness himself states in his\\nstatement of 4 th June 2018 (at page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs bundle) when he\\nmakes it clear that ‚ÄúI am aware‚Äù or that ‚ÄúI have acknowledged‚Äù. In any\\nevent, what the judge is referring to is actually what Mr [S] himself said in\\nhis evidence where he makes it clear that as a director of the voluntary\\norganisation he supports gay asylum seekers taking each claim at face\\nvalue. Accordingly, the decision of the judge in this particular case was\\nclear, comprehensive, and well-reasoned and there is no error of law in it.\\nDecision\\n15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an\\nerror of law. The decision shall stand.\\n16. An anonymity order is made.\\n17. The appeal is dismissed.\\n4Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018\\nDirection Regarding Anonymity ‚Äì Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure\\n(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008\\nUnless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted\\nanonymity.

This is the Appellant‚Äôs appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Boylan-Kemp MBE dated 2 May 2019 dismissing the Appellant‚Äôs appeal against the Respondent‚Äôs decision of 23 November 2018 refusing his human rights and protection claim. ¬© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019 2. The Appellant is a national of Iraq of Kurdish origin and from Sulamaniyah in the IKR. He gave an account that he was at risk of serious harm in the IKR by reason of his family and extended tribe being in a feud with another tribe in the IKR. The Appellant was not able to give many details of the origins of the feud but stated that one family member had been killed as a result of it and that he himself had experienced two incidents; one being that unknown persons had fired upon a car in which he was travelling and his cousin had been injured in the shoulder, and another occasion when the house in which he lived was fired upon. 3. The Respondent in its decision refusing the protection claim disbelieved the Appellant‚Äôs account that there was any feud on the grounds that the Appellant knew very few details of the alleged feud. There was also said to be a discrepancy as between the Appellant‚Äôs evidence in interview as to how many occasions the Appellant experienced any problems himself (refusal letter, para [26]) and a discrepancy between an alleged fear of his own father (resulting from the Appellant refusing to take part in the feud) and information given in an age assessment interview in which he had stated that he had a good relationship with his family members (para [31]). 4. The Appellant appealed against that decision and the matter came before the judge at the Birmingham hearing centre on 18 March 2019. The Appellant was represented and gave evidence. At the date of that hearing the Appellant would have been 18 years of age. A further document was relied upon by the Respondent at that hearing, being a EURODAC search result, demonstrating that a person in the Appellant‚Äôs identity was fingerprinted in Dresden in Germany on 22 March 2016. The Appellant‚Äôs account as given in his SEF interview and confirmed in oral evidence before the judge was that he only left Iraq in December 2017. The Appellant denied before the judge that the person identified in the EURODAC search was him but the judge stated that she was satisfied by the details contained within the document, and looking at the clear photograph on the EURODAC match, that the person fingerprinted in Germany was indeed the Appellant. 5. The judge found at paragraph 14 onwards as follows: ‚Äú16. The evidence provided by the EURODAC document is unequivocal. The photograph contained within the document is clearly the Appellant who appeared before me and I have no reason to doubt that the document relates to him. Therefore this document upon which I am satisfied I can place significant weight puts him in Germany on 22 March 2016. Consequently I find that this evidence undermines the credibility of his entire account and his credibility as a witness in his own cause and that it renders his entire account unreliable. 2Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019 17. Further I also find his inability to recall the details of the alleged feud which caused him to leave his family and flee the country to also not be credible. If a young man was leaving his life behind because of his reluctance to become involved in an ongoing family feud then I would anticipate that he would have knowledge of what he is in fear of and so I do not find it plausible that he would not know the details of this feud if he held such a genuine fear. Also I note that even on his own evidence there has been no specific risk or threat made to him which would cause him to fear for his own safety beyond what is a more general tribal threat and of which he cannot provide much detail. ... 18. As I have found the Appellant‚Äôs alleged reasoning for leaving Iraq to not be credible then I also find that it is not plausible that his family have consequently threatened him as claimed due to his alleged desertion because of the alleged feud. Instead I find that he has travelled to the UK with the assistance and knowledge of his family for reasons other than escaping a risk of persecution. As such I find that his family would therefore be able to assist him with obtaining a copy of his identification documents and CSID which would help facilitate his return to Iraq. I also find that he would be able to return to the help and support of his family there.‚Äù The judge dismissed the Appellant‚Äôs appeal. 6. The Appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal on grounds dated 15 May 2019 which argue very briefly that the judge erred in law at paragraphs 15 to 20 by giving inadequate reasoning for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account to not be credible and secondly that the judge had failed to apply relevant country guidance. 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Keane on 24 June 2019. The judge stated as follows: ‚ÄúThe judge arguably had regard to irrelevant considerations in finding that the Appellant had not given a credible account of events. The judge‚Äôs findings as to the credibility were to be found at paragraphs 15 to 18 inclusive of her decision. At paragraph 15 the judge attached weight so as to undermine the Appellant‚Äôs credibility to a EURODAC printout provided by the Respondent which as the judge found proved that the Appellant was photographed and printed in Germany on 22 March 2016. The judge however did not explain why such circumstance damaged the Appellant‚Äôs credibility. If the judge had in mind the Appellant‚Äôs apparent failure to claim asylum in Germany the judge arguably should have stated so. At paragraph 16 of the decision the judge again accorded weight to the EURODAC document without stating why. At paragraph 17 of the decision the 3Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019 judge stated that the judge would have anticipated that the Appellant would have had knowledge of the alleged feud which on his case caused him to leave his family and indeed his country. The judge arguably substituted her own understanding of what constituted reasonable conduct in circumstances where arguably she should not have done so. At paragraph 18 the judge stated that it was not plausible that the Appellant‚Äôs family have consequently threatened him on account of his ostensible desertion and the judge was arguably disbelieving the Appellant‚Äôs account without providing any or adequate reasons. It was incumbent on the judge in resolving the issue of credibility to embark upon a global assessment of the Appellant‚Äôs credibility and to provide adequate reasons in support of a finding that he had not done so. This the judge arguably failed to do.‚Äù Submissions 8. Mr Sharif relies upon the grounds of appeal and the admittedly more extensive grant of permission to appeal in support of his Appellant‚Äôs case. 9. Mr Sharif points out that the only date given in the Appellant‚Äôs account for any particular incident was in relation to the incident when the car in which the Appellant was travelling had been shot at. The date for that is to be found in the SEF interview at [86] and was simply ‚Äò2016‚Äô. The Appellant gives no other dates for the matters that he relies upon in support of the proposition that he is at risk because of a blood feud in Iraq. He does however consistently state that he left Iraq in December 2017. Mr Sharif argues that the Appellant had accepted in the course of his evidence that he had travelled through Germany and therefore the evidence from the EURODAC search confirming that did not alter the credibility of the Appellant‚Äôs account. Mr Sharif also argued that the judge‚Äôs findings in relation to it being incredible that the Appellant would not have had more knowledge about the details of the feud was an irrational finding on the part of the judge. 10. For his part Mr Mills defends the judge‚Äôs decision and argues that the dishonest statement that the Appellant had remained in December 2017 was clearly capable of affecting the credibility of the Appellant‚Äôs account. I raised with him whether or not such a discrepancy could be treated as determinative of the account given that there were no dates given in the Appellant‚Äôs account of matters occurring in Iraq any later than 22 March 2016. Mr Mills appeared to accept that it was right to say that the Appellant‚Äôs credibility was not determinatively decided by the discrepancy of his whereabouts in March 2016. However Mr Mills points to the other findings at paragraph 17 in support of the judge‚Äôs reasoning. Discussion 11. I find no material error of law in the judge‚Äôs decision. The suggestion in the grant of permission to appeal by Judge Keane that the judge had 4Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019 arguably had regard to irrelevant considerations is difficult to sustain. The Appellant has clearly given inconsistent evidence about his whereabouts, on the one part insisting that he remained in Iraq in December 2017 but incontrovertible evidence existing from the EURODAC search result that he was present in Germany on 22 March 2016. These two items of evidence simply cannot sit together. True it is that there are no details of the Appellant‚Äôs account of any incidents that he has set out which are dated any later than 22 March 2016, and therefore being shot at in ‚Äò2016‚Äô and him departing Iraq prior to 22 March 2016 does not necessarily make his account impossible to believe, but it is clearly a very significant matter that the Appellant has lied about his continued presence in Iraq up to the point of December 2017 and the judge was fully entitled to treat that as a very significant matter. Whether or not she was entitled to treat it as rendering ‚Äòhis entire account unreliable‚Äô is moot. 12. However the judge does not stop there in her credibility findings because she continues, as is clear at paragraph 17, to set out other reasons for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account incredible. Whereas it may be expected that a young person may not be as fully informed about the details of a feud affecting his family and the wider tribe as might a fully-grown adult, the judge‚Äôs point is that the Appellant decided, together with the assistance of a relative, to leave Iraq because of this feud and the judge was entitled to find that it was implausible that the Appellant knew so little about the feud whereas it had been the specific cause of his decision to leave the country. I find that it was not irrational for the judge to make the findings that she did at paragraph 17. There are a number of reasons therefore given by the judge for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account incredible and I find that none of those reasons is vitiated by any error of law. 13. Judge Keane in granting permission did not comment upon the Appellant‚Äôs actual second ground which was that the judge had failed to apply country guidance relevant to the issue of obtaining documents for readmission and residence in Iraq. However in the light of my decision that the judge‚Äôs credibility findings are sustainable it is also sustainable that the Appellant can have the assistance of family members in Iraq to obtain any replacement documents that are needed to facilitate his return to, and residence in Iraq. Notice of Decision The judge‚Äôs decision did not involve the making of any material error of law. I do not set aside the decision. The Appellant‚Äôs appeal is dismissed.

This is an appeal against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pacey, promulgated on 24 th June 2018, following a hearing at Birmingham on 6 th June 2018. In the determination, the judge dismissed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Appellant subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me. The Appellant ¬© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Iran, and was born on 22 nd July 1996. He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 24 th April 2018 refusing his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection pursuant to paragraph 339C of HC 395. The Appellant‚Äôs Claim 3. The essence of the Appellant‚Äôs claim is that he is a member of a particular social group, because he is a gay Iranian man who would face persecution if returned, and additionally he is also an atheist, who would be ill-treated upon return as a non-religious person, which is forbidden in Iran. The Judge‚Äôs Findings 4. The judge noted how the Appellant in his screening interview has said that he held no religion and that he would be subject to persecution as a non- religious person if returned to Iran. He made no mention at that stage that he was also a gay person. During his asylum interview, however, he stated that he was a danger also because he was a homosexual and feared the government given that homosexuality was punishable by death. He had not mentioned this at his screening interview because he did not know anything about the country he was coming to. The Appellant had then explained how he had a boyfriend in the UK by the name of [FS], with whom he had been in relationship for about one and a half months. He also had three serious relationships which he went on to describe in evidence before the Tribunal. The judge did not find the Appellant to be credible because the appellant‚Äôs explanation that he had not mentioned his homosexuality during his screening interview, because he did not know the country he was coming to, was not plausible. As the judge explained, ‚Äúif he did not know the UK approach to homosexuality ... he could not have known if the UK adopted as punitive an approach to gay people as did Iran.... For all he knew he could have been travelling from the frying pan into the fire‚Äù (paragraph 68). 5. On the other hand, the judge observed that if the Appellant was aware of the actual UK approach to homosexuality, ‚Äúthen there was no reason for him not to have mentioned his sexuality at the screening interview‚Äù (paragraph 69). 6. The judge was also not impressed by the witnesses before the Tribunal. In short, the Appellant‚Äôs claim was rejected wholesale. The appeal was dismissed. Grounds of Application 7. The grounds of application state that the judge had engaged in a material error of law in relation to the evidence of a Miss [L] and that of Mr [S] whose credibility had been wrongly impugned by the judge. There had been apparently a discrepancy between to the oral and the written 2Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018 evidence of Miss [L], but this discrepancy had not been put to the witness, and if this was so then this was contrary to the rules of natural justice. 8. On 23 rd November 2018 permission to appeal was granted. Submissions 9. At the hearing before me on 5 th July 2019, the Appellant was represented by Mr Howard, who adopted the grounds of application. He submitted that if the judge was concerned about the discrepancy in the oral and written evidence of Miss [L], then this should have been explored by the Tribunal, because in her oral evidence, Miss [L] had said that she had ‚Äúnot met [F]‚Äù, whereas in her written evidence she had said that ‚Äúshe also knew his previous partner, [F]‚Äù (paragraph 34). Secondly, Mr Howard submitted that if one looks at the evidence of Mr [S] (at page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs bundle). He makes it quite clear that he is the director of a voluntary organisation called Persian LGBT Advisory Services, where it provides ‚Äúvoluntary social activities for LGBT asylum seekers‚Äù. He explains that the appellant had contacted him via Facebook on 9 th June 2016. He invited the Appellant to meet with him, and after a conversation he had come to the view that ‚ÄúI am aware the Appellant is openly active on Facebook page which I would refer to as an online activist where he shares information on LGBT community using his Facebook page...‚Äù. On that basis that the judge was wrong to have impugned his credibility. 10. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that the issues that were before the judge, both in relation to the Appellant‚Äôs atheism and his homosexual tendencies, were not new issues. If evidence was collected by the Appellant between the asylum interview and the Tribunal hearing, in a manner that the Appellant himself chose to do, then he should have been prepared to deal with it on the basis of oral testimony. These were not new points. The witnesses were not people whose evidence had previously been accepted. Both cases were simply black and white discrepancy cases where the judge was entitled to say that she would not attach any significant weight to such evidence, because as put before the Tribunal, the evidence was not persuasive. No Error of Law 11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did not involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision. My reasons are as follows. First, it is simply not correct to say that the discrepancy in the oral and witness statement evidence of Miss [L] was something that the judge should have probed herself with a view to ascertaining exactly what Miss [L] knew about Mr [F]. The judge noted that in her oral evidence Miss [L] stated she was aware that the Appellant had a relationship in the UK ‚Äúbut had not met [F]‚Äù. Then the judge noted how in her witness statement, Miss [L] had stated that she became friends with the Appellant when she met him in Calais at the ‚Äúthe jungle‚Äù in April 2016, and ‚Äúwhen they became strong 3Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018 friends he told her of his fear of persecution and that he was an atheist. She also knew his previous partner, [F]‚Äù (paragraph 34). It was for the Appellant‚Äôs representative to probe this matter further. As the evidence stood, the judge was entitled to conclude that ‚ÄúMiss [L] has also been inconsistent in a written and oral account of whether she had met [F]‚Äù (paragraph 78). 12. Second, as far as Mr [S]‚Äôs evidence is concerned, I note that he is a director of the voluntary organisation called Persian LGBT Advisory Services. He wrote in terms that he was ‚Äúaware the Appellant is openly active on Facebook page‚Äù. He had stated that ‚ÄúI have acknowledged that the Appellant has made a strong relationship with the wider LGBT communities ...‚Äù. He had further stated that ‚ÄúI have also seen that the Appellant has participated openly at this year‚Äôs LGBT Pride with Christian LGBT parade ...‚Äù. He ended his statement by declaring that ‚Äúbased on information that has been provided by the Appellant I can confirm that he is homosexual and would be subject of persecution...‚Äù. (See page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs bundle). The manner in which the judge dealt with this evidence was one which was entirely open to her to do. What the judge states is that she would ‚Äúattach very little weight to Mr [S]‚Äôs evidence‚Äù because ‚Äúhe said at the hearing that he had attended court since 2008 to support gay asylum seekers‚Äù. 13. Nevertheless as the judge observed, ‚Äúhis support did not, on his own evidence, comprise independent verification of each Appellant‚Äôs claim since he took the claim of each at face value, entirely taking their word for it without doing anything to verify their claim, in the way of what might be termed ‚Äòdue diligence‚Äô. While he may well be well-meaning, the uncritical nature of his support means it is of very little probative value‚Äù (paragraph 79). 14. There is nothing in this particular analysis of the judge‚Äôs detailed explanation that sits ill at ease with what the witness himself states in his statement of 4 th June 2018 (at page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs bundle) when he makes it clear that ‚ÄúI am aware‚Äù or that ‚ÄúI have acknowledged‚Äù. In any event, what the judge is referring to is actually what Mr [S] himself said in his evidence where he makes it clear that as a director of the voluntary organisation he supports gay asylum seekers taking each claim at face value. Accordingly, the decision of the judge in this particular case was clear, comprehensive, and well-reasoned and there is no error of law in it. Decision 15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error of law. The decision shall stand. 16. An anonymity order is made. 17. The appeal is dismissed. 4Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018 Direction Regarding Anonymity ‚Äì Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of their family. This direction applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent.

      "2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Iran, and was born on 22nd July 1996.\n",
      "He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 24th April 2018\n",
      "refusing his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection pursuant to\n",
      "paragraph 339C of HC 395.\n",
      "The Appellant‚Äôs Claim\n",
      "3. The essence of the Appellant‚Äôs claim is that he is a member of a particular\n",
      "social group, because he is a gay Iranian man who would face persecution\n",
      "if returned, and additionally he is also an atheist, who would be ill-treated\n",
      "upon return as a non-religious person, which is forbidden in Iran.  \n",
      "The Judge‚Äôs Findings\n",
      "4. The judge noted how the Appellant in his screening interview has said that\n",
      "he held no religion and that he would be subject to persecution as a non-\n",
      "religious person if returned to Iran.  He made no mention at that stage\n",
      "that he was also a gay person.  During his asylum interview, however, he\n",
      "stated that he was a danger also because he was a homosexual and\n",
      "feared the government given that homosexuality was punishable by\n",
      "death.  He had not mentioned this at his screening interview because he\n",
      "did not know anything about the country he was coming to.  The Appellant\n",
      "had then explained how he had a boyfriend in the UK by the name of [FS],\n",
      "with whom he had been in relationship for about one and a half months.\n",
      "He also had three serious relationships which he went on to describe in\n",
      "evidence before the Tribunal.  The judge did not find the Appellant to be\n",
      "credible because the appellant‚Äôs explanation that he had not mentioned\n",
      "his homosexuality during his screening interview, because he did not know\n",
      "the country he was coming to, was not plausible.  As the judge explained,\n",
      "‚Äúif he did not know the UK approach to homosexuality ‚Ä¶ he could not\n",
      "have known if the UK adopted as punitive an approach to gay people as\n",
      "did Iran‚Ä¶.  For all he knew he could have been travelling from the frying\n",
      "pan into the fire‚Äù (paragraph 68).  \n",
      "5. On the other hand, the judge observed that if the Appellant was aware of\n",
      "the actual UK approach to homosexuality, ‚Äúthen there was no reason for\n",
      "him not to have mentioned his sexuality at the screening interview‚Äù\n",
      "(paragraph 69).  \n",
      "6. The judge was also not impressed by the witnesses before the Tribunal.  In\n",
      "short, the Appellant‚Äôs claim was rejected wholesale.   The appeal was\n",
      "dismissed.\n",
      "Grounds of Application\n",
      "7. The grounds of application state that the judge had engaged in a material\n",
      "error of law in relation to the evidence of a Miss [L] and that of Mr [S]\n",
      "whose credibility had been wrongly impugned by the judge.  There had\n",
      "been apparently a discrepancy between to the oral and the written\n",
      "2\n",
      "Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018\n",
      "evidence of Miss [L], but this discrepancy had not been put to the witness,\n",
      "and if this was so then this was contrary to the rules of natural justice.  \n",
      "8. On 23rd November 2018 permission to appeal was granted.  \n",
      "Submissions\n",
      "9. At the hearing before me on 5th July 2019, the Appellant was represented\n",
      "by Mr Howard, who adopted the grounds of application.  He submitted that\n",
      "if the judge was concerned about the discrepancy in the oral and written\n",
      "evidence of Miss [L], then this should have been explored by the Tribunal,\n",
      "because in her oral evidence, Miss [L] had said that she had ‚Äúnot met [F]‚Äù,\n",
      "whereas in her written evidence she had said that ‚Äúshe also knew his\n",
      "previous partner, [F]‚Äù (paragraph 34).  Secondly, Mr Howard submitted\n",
      "that if one looks at the evidence of Mr [S] (at page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs\n",

      "organisation called Persian LGBT Advisory Services, where it provides\n",
      "‚Äúvoluntary social activities for LGBT asylum seekers‚Äù.  He explains that the\n",
      "appellant had contacted him via Facebook on 9th June 2016.  He invited\n",
      "the Appellant to meet with him, and after a conversation he had come to\n",
      "the view that ‚ÄúI am aware the Appellant is openly active on Facebook page\n",
      "which I would refer to as an online activist where he shares information on\n",
      "LGBT community using his Facebook page‚Ä¶‚Äù.   On that basis that the\n",
      "judge was wrong to have impugned his credibility. \n",
      "10. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that the issues that were before the judge,\n",
      "both in relation to the Appellant‚Äôs atheism and his homosexual tendencies,\n",
      "were not new issues.  If evidence was collected by the Appellant between\n",
      "the asylum interview and the Tribunal hearing, in a manner that the\n",
      "Appellant himself chose to do, then he should have been prepared to deal\n",
      "with it on the basis of oral testimony.  These were not new points.  The\n",
      "witnesses were not people whose evidence had previously been accepted.\n",
      "Both cases were simply black and white discrepancy cases where the\n",
      "judge was entitled to say that she would not attach any significant weight\n",
      "to such evidence, because as put before the Tribunal, the evidence was\n",
      "not persuasive.  \n",
      "No Error of Law\n",
      "11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did not involve\n",
      "the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007)\n",
      "such that I should set aside the decision.  My reasons are as follows.  First,\n",
      "it is simply not correct to say that the discrepancy in the oral and witness\n",
      "statement evidence of Miss [L] was something that the judge should have\n",
      "probed herself with a view to ascertaining exactly what Miss [L] knew\n",
      "about Mr [F].  The judge noted that in her oral evidence Miss [L] stated she\n",
      "was aware that the Appellant had a relationship in the UK ‚Äúbut had not\n",
      "met [F]‚Äù.  Then the judge noted how in her witness statement, Miss [L] had\n",

This is an appeal against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge\\nPacey, promulgated on 24th June 2018, following a hearing at Birmingham\\non 6th June 2018.  In the determination, the judge dismissed the appeal of\\nthe Appellant, whereupon the Appellant subsequently applied for, and was\\ngranted, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter\\ncomes before me.\\nThe Appellant\\n¬© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019\\nAppeal Number: PA/05945/2018\\n2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Iran, and was born on 22nd July 1996.\\nHe appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 24th April 2018\\nrefusing his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection pursuant to\\nparagraph 339C of HC 395.\\nThe Appellant‚Äôs Claim\\n3. The essence of the Appellant‚Äôs claim is that he is a member of a particular\\nsocial group, because he is a gay Iranian man who would face persecution\\nif returned, and additionally he is also an atheist, who would be ill-treated\\nupon return as a non-religious person, which is forbidden in Iran.  \\nThe Judge‚Äôs Findings\\n4. The judge noted how the Appellant in his screening interview has said that\\nhe held no religion and that he would be subject to persecution as a non-\\nreligious person if returned to Iran.  He made no mention at that stage\\nthat he was also a gay person.  During his asylum interview, however, he\\nstated that he was a danger also because he was a homosexual and\\nfeared the government given that homosexuality was punishable by\\ndeath.  He had not mentioned this at his screening interview because he\\ndid not know anything about the country he was coming to.  The Appellant\\nhad then explained how he had a boyfriend in the UK by the name of [FS],\\nwith whom he had been in relationship for about one and a half months.\\nHe also had three serious relationships which he went on to describe in\\nevidence before the Tribunal.  The judge did not find the Appellant to be\\ncredible because the appellant‚Äôs explanation that he had not mentioned\\nhis homosexuality during his screening interview, because he did not know\\nthe country he was coming to, was not plausible.  As the judge explained,\\n‚Äúif he did not know the UK approach to homosexuality ‚Ä¶ he could not\\nhave known if the UK adopted as punitive an approach to gay people as\\ndid Iran‚Ä¶.  For all he knew he could have been travelling from the frying\\npan into the fire‚Äù (paragraph 68).  \\n5. On the other hand, the judge observed that if the Appellant was aware of\\nthe actual UK approach to homosexuality, ‚Äúthen there was no reason for\\nhim not to have mentioned his sexuality at the screening interview‚Äù\\n(paragraph 69).  \\n6. The judge was also not impressed by the witnesses before the Tribunal.  In\\nshort, the Appellant‚Äôs claim was rejected wholesale.   The appeal was\\ndismissed.\\nGrounds of Application\\n7. The grounds of application state that the judge had engaged in a material\\nerror of law in relation to the evidence of a Miss [L] and that of Mr [S]\\nwhose credibility had been wrongly impugned by the judge.  There had\\nbeen apparently a discrepancy between to the oral and the written\\n2\\nAppeal Number: PA/05945/2018\\nevidence of Miss [L], but this discrepancy had not been put to the witness,\\nand if this was so then this was contrary to the rules of natural justice.  \\n8. On 23rd November 2018 permission to appeal was granted.  \\nSubmissions\\n9. At the hearing before me on 5th July 2019, the Appellant was represented\\nby Mr Howard, who adopted the grounds of application.  He submitted that\\nif the judge was concerned about the discrepancy in the oral and written\\nevidence of Miss [L], then this should have been explored by the Tribunal,\\nbecause in her oral evidence, Miss [L] had said that she had ‚Äúnot met [F]‚Äù,\\nwhereas in her written evidence she had said that ‚Äúshe also knew his\\nprevious partner, [F]‚Äù (paragraph 34).  Secondly, Mr Howard submitted\\nthat if one looks at the evidence of Mr [S] (at page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs\\nbundle).  He makes it quite clear that he is the director of a voluntary\\norganisation called Persian LGBT Advisory Services, where it provides\\n‚Äúvoluntary social activities for LGBT asylum seekers‚Äù.  He explains that the\\nappellant had contacted him via Facebook on 9th June 2016.  He invited\\nthe Appellant to meet with him, and after a conversation he had come to\\nthe view that ‚ÄúI am aware the Appellant is openly active on Facebook page\\nwhich I would refer to as an online activist where he shares information on\\nLGBT community using his Facebook page‚Ä¶‚Äù.   On that basis that the\\njudge was wrong to have impugned his credibility. \\n10. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that the issues that were before the judge,\\nboth in relation to the Appellant‚Äôs atheism and his homosexual tendencies,\\nwere not new issues.  If evidence was collected by the Appellant between\\nthe asylum interview and the Tribunal hearing, in a manner that the\\nAppellant himself chose to do, then he should have been prepared to deal\\nwith it on the basis of oral testimony.  These were not new points.  The\\nwitnesses were not people whose evidence had previously been accepted.\\nBoth cases were simply black and white discrepancy cases where the\\njudge was entitled to say that she would not attach any significant weight\\nto such evidence, because as put before the Tribunal, the evidence was\\nnot persuasive.  \\nNo Error of Law\\n11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did not involve\\nthe making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007)\\nsuch that I should set aside the decision.  My reasons are as follows.  First,\\nit is simply not correct to say that the discrepancy in the oral and witness\\nstatement evidence of Miss [L] was something that the judge should have\\nprobed herself with a view to ascertaining exactly what Miss [L] knew\\nabout Mr [F].  The judge noted that in her oral evidence Miss [L] stated she\\nwas aware that the Appellant had a relationship in the UK ‚Äúbut had not\\nmet [F]‚Äù.  Then the judge noted how in her witness statement, Miss [L] had\\nstated that she became friends with the Appellant when she met him in\\nCalais at the ‚Äúthe jungle‚Äù in April 2016, and ‚Äúwhen they became strong\\n3\\n \\nUpper Tribunal \\n(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018\\nTHE IMMIGRATION ACTS\\nHeard at Birmingham CJC Decision & Reasons Promulgated\\nOn 5th July 2019 On 19th August 2019\\nBefore\\nDEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE JUSS\\nBetween\\nHA\\n(ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)\\nAppellant\\nand\\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT\\nRespondent\\nRepresentation:\\nFor the Appellant: Mr J Howard (Solicitor)\\nFor the Respondent: Mr D Mills (Senior HOPO)\\nDECISION AND REASONS\\n1.

This is the Appellant‚Äôs appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier\\nTribunal Boylan-Kemp MBE dated 2 May 2019 dismissing the Appellant‚Äôs\\nappeal against the Respondent‚Äôs decision of 23 November 2018 refusing\\nhis human rights and protection claim.  \\n¬© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019\\nAppeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\n2. The Appellant is a national of Iraq of Kurdish origin and from Sulamaniyah\\nin the IKR.  He gave an account that he was at risk of serious harm in the\\nIKR by reason of his family and extended tribe being in a feud with another\\ntribe in the IKR.  The Appellant was not able to give many details of the\\norigins of the feud but stated that one family member had been killed as a\\nresult of it and that he himself had experienced two incidents; one being\\nthat unknown persons had fired upon a car in which he was travelling and\\nhis cousin had been injured in the shoulder, and another occasion when\\nthe house in which he lived was fired upon.  \\n3. The Respondent in its decision refusing the protection claim disbelieved\\nthe Appellant‚Äôs account that there was any feud on the grounds that the\\nAppellant knew very few details of the alleged feud.  There was also said\\nto be a discrepancy as between the Appellant‚Äôs evidence in interview as to\\nhow many occasions the Appellant experienced any problems himself\\n(refusal letter, para [26]) and a discrepancy between an alleged fear of his\\nown father (resulting from the Appellant refusing to take part in the feud)\\nand information given in an age assessment interview in which he had\\nstated that he had a good relationship with his family members (para\\n[31]).  \\n4. The Appellant appealed against that decision and the matter came before\\nthe judge at the Birmingham hearing centre on 18 March 2019.   The\\nAppellant was represented and gave evidence.  At the date of that hearing\\nthe Appellant would have been 18 years of age.  A further document was\\nrelied upon by the Respondent at that hearing, being a EURODAC search\\nresult, demonstrating that a person in the  Appellant‚Äôs  identity was\\nfingerprinted in Dresden in Germany on 22 March 2016.  The Appellant‚Äôs\\naccount as given in his SEF interview and confirmed in oral evidence\\nbefore the judge was that he only left Iraq in December 2017.   The\\nAppellant denied before the judge that the person identified in the\\nEURODAC search was him but the judge stated that she was satisfied by\\nthe details contained within the document, and looking at the clear\\nphotograph on the EURODAC match, that the person fingerprinted in\\nGermany was indeed the Appellant.  \\n5. The judge found at paragraph 14 onwards as follows: \\n‚Äú16. The   evidence   provided   by   the   EURODAC   document   is\\nunequivocal.  The photograph contained within the document is\\nclearly the Appellant who appeared before me and I have no\\nreason to doubt that the document relates to him.  Therefore this\\ndocument upon which I am satisfied I can place significant weight\\nputs him in Germany on 22 March 2016.  Consequently I find that\\nthis evidence undermines the credibility of his entire account and\\nhis credibility as a witness in his own cause and that it renders\\nhis entire account unreliable.  \\n2\\nAppeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\n17. Further I also find his inability to recall the details of the alleged\\nfeud which caused him to leave his family and flee the country to\\nalso not be credible.  If a young man was leaving his life behind\\nbecause of his reluctance to become involved in an ongoing\\nfamily   feud   then   I   would   anticipate   that   he   would   have\\nknowledge of what he is in fear of and so I do not find it plausible\\nthat he would not know the details of this feud if he held such a\\ngenuine fear.  Also I note that even on his own evidence there\\nhas been no specific risk or threat made to him which would\\ncause him to fear for his own safety beyond what is a more\\ngeneral tribal threat and of which he cannot provide much detail.\\n‚Ä¶\\n18. As I have found the Appellant‚Äôs alleged reasoning for leaving Iraq\\nto not be credible then I also find that it is not plausible that his\\nfamily have consequently threatened him as claimed due to his\\nalleged desertion because of the alleged feud.  Instead I find that\\nhe has travelled to the UK with the assistance and knowledge of\\nhis family for reasons other than escaping a risk of persecution.\\nAs such I find that his family would therefore be able to assist\\nhim with obtaining a copy of his identification documents and\\nCSID which would help facilitate his return to Iraq.  I also find that\\nhe would be able to return to the help and support of his family\\nthere.‚Äù\\nThe judge dismissed the Appellant‚Äôs appeal.  \\n6. The Appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal on grounds dated 15 May\\n2019 which argue very briefly that the judge erred in law at paragraphs 15\\nto 20 by giving inadequate reasoning for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account to\\nnot be credible and secondly that the judge had failed to apply relevant\\ncountry guidance.  \\n7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Keane\\non 24 June 2019.  The judge stated as follows:\\n‚ÄúThe judge arguably had regard to irrelevant considerations in finding\\nthat the Appellant had not given a credible account of events.  The\\njudge‚Äôs findings as to the credibility were to be found at paragraphs\\n15 to 18 inclusive of her decision.   At paragraph 15 the judge\\nattached weight so as to undermine the Appellant‚Äôs credibility to a\\nEURODAC printout provided by the Respondent which as the judge\\nfound proved that the Appellant was photographed and printed in\\nGermany on 22 March 2016.  The judge however did not explain why\\nsuch circumstance damaged the Appellant‚Äôs credibility.  If the judge\\nhad in mind the Appellant‚Äôs apparent failure to claim asylum in\\nGermany the judge arguably should have stated so.  At paragraph 16\\nof the decision the judge again accorded weight to the EURODAC\\ndocument without stating why.  At paragraph 17 of the decision the\\n3\\nUpper Tribunal \\n(Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\nTHE IMMIGRATION ACTS\\nHeard at Birmingham CJC Decision   &   Reasons\\nPromulgated\\nOn 8 November 2019 On 21 November 2019\\nBefore\\nDEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE O‚ÄôRYAN\\nBetween\\nMR D A\\n(ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)\\nAppellant\\nand\\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT\\nRespondent\\nRepresentation:\\nFor the Appellant: Mr Sharif, Fountain Solicitors \\nFor the Respondent: Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer \\nDECISION AND REASONS\\n1. This is the Appellant‚Äôs appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier\\nTribunal Boylan-Kemp MBE dated 2 May 2019 dismissing the Appellant‚Äôs\\nappeal against the Respondent‚Äôs decision of 23 November 2018 refusing\\nhis human rights and protection claim.  \\n¬© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019\\nAppeal Number: PA/00240/2019\\narguably had regard to irrelevant considerations is difficult to sustain.  The\\nAppellant has clearly given inconsistent evidence about his whereabouts,\\non the one part insisting that he remained in Iraq in December 2017 but\\nincontrovertible evidence existing from the EURODAC search result that he\\nwas present in Germany on 22 March 2016.  These two items of evidence\\nsimply cannot sit together.  True it is that there are no details of the\\nAppellant‚Äôs account of any incidents that he has set out which are dated\\nany later than 22 March 2016, and therefore being shot at in ‚Äò2016‚Äô and\\nhim departing Iraq prior to 22 March 2016 does not necessarily make his\\naccount impossible to believe, but it is clearly a very significant matter\\nthat the Appellant has lied about his continued presence in Iraq up to the\\npoint of December 2017 and the judge was fully entitled to treat that as a\\nvery significant matter.  Whether or not she was entitled to treat it as\\nrendering ‚Äòhis entire account unreliable‚Äô is moot.  \\n12. However the judge does not stop there in her credibility findings because\\nshe continues, as is clear at paragraph 17, to set out other reasons for\\nfinding the Appellant‚Äôs account incredible.  Whereas it may be expected\\nthat a young person may not be as fully informed about the details of a\\nfeud affecting his family and the wider tribe as might a fully-grown adult,\\nthe   judge‚Äôs   point  is   that   the   Appellant   decided,   together   with   the\\nassistance of a relative, to leave Iraq because of this feud and the judge\\nwas entitled to find that it was implausible that the Appellant knew so little\\nabout the feud whereas it had been the specific cause of his decision to\\nleave the country.  I find that it was not irrational for the judge to make\\nthe findings that she did at paragraph 17.  There are a number of reasons\\ntherefore given by the judge for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account incredible\\nand I find that none of those reasons is vitiated by any error of law.  \\n13. Judge Keane in granting permission did not comment upon the Appellant‚Äôs\\nactual second ground which was that the judge had failed to apply country\\nguidance relevant to the issue of obtaining documents for readmission and\\nresidence in Iraq.  However in the light of my decision that the judge‚Äôs\\ncredibility findings are sustainable it is also sustainable that the Appellant\\ncan have  the assistance  of family members in Iraq to obtain  any\\nreplacement documents that are needed to facilitate his return to, and\\nresidence in Iraq.  \\nNotice of Decision\\nThe judge‚Äôs decision did not involve the making of any material error of\\nlaw.  \\nI do not set aside the decision.  \\nThe Appellant‚Äôs appeal is dismissed.  \\nSigned Date 20.11.19\\n5'"

       "'upper tribunal (immigration and asylum chamber) appeal number: pa/00240/2019 the immigration acts heard at birmingham cjc decision & reasons promulgated on 21 november 2019 on 8 november 2019 before deputy upper tribunal judge o‚Äôryan between mr d a (anonymity direction made) appellant and the secretary of state for the home department respondent representation: for the appellant: mr sharif, fountain solicitors for the respondent: mr mills, senior home office presenting officer decision and reasons 1. this is the appellant‚Äôs appeal against the decision of judge of the first-tier tribunal boylan-kemp mbe dated 2 may 2019 dismissing the appellant‚Äôs appeal against the respondent‚Äôs decision of 23 november 2018 refusing his human rights and protection claim. ¬© crown copyright 2019appeal number: pa/00240/2019 2. the appellant is a national of iraq of kurdish origin and from sulamaniyah in the ikr. he gave an account that he was at risk of serious harm in the ikr by reason of his family and extended tribe being in a feud with another tribe in the ikr. the appellant was not able to give many details of the origins of the feud but stated that one family member had been killed as a result of it and that he himself had experienced two incidents; one being that unknown persons had fired upon a car in which he was travelling and his cousin had been injured in the shoulder, and another occasion when the house in which he lived was fired upon. 3. the respondent in its decision refusing the protection claim disbelieved the appellant‚Äôs account that there was any feud on the grounds that the appellant knew very few details of the alleged feud. there was also said to be a discrepancy as between the appellant‚Äôs evidence in interview as to how many occasions the appellant experienced any problems himself (refusal letter, para [26]) and a discrepancy between an alleged fear of his own father (resulting from the appellant refusing to take part in the feud) and information given in an age assessment interview in which he had stated that he had a good relationship with his family members (para [31]). 4. the appellant appealed against that decision and the matter came before the judge at the birmingham hearing centre on 18 march 2019. the appellant was represented and gave evidence. at the date of that hearing the appellant would have been 18 years of age. a further document was relied upon by the respondent at that hearing, being a eurodac search result, demonstrating that a person in the appellant‚Äôs identity was fingerprinted in dresden in germany on 22 march 2016. the appellant‚Äôs account as given in his sef interview and confirmed in oral evidence before the judge was that he only left iraq in december 2017. the appellant denied before the judge that the person identified in the eurodac search was him but the judge stated that she was satisfied by the details contained within the document, and looking at the clear photograph on the eurodac match, that the person fingerprinted in germany was indeed the appellant. 5. the judge found at paragraph 14 onwards as follows: ‚Äú16. the evidence provided by the eurodac document is unequivocal. the photograph contained within the document is clearly the appellant who appeared before me and i have no reason to doubt that the document relates to him. therefore this document upon which i am satisfied i can place significant weight puts him in germany on 22 march 2016. consequently i find that this evidence undermines the credibility of his entire account and his credibility as a witness in his own cause and that it renders his entire account unreliable. 2appeal number: pa/00240/2019 17. further i also find his inability to recall the details of the alleged feud which caused him to leave his family and flee the country to also not be credible. if a young man was leaving his life behind because of his reluctance to become involved in an ongoing family feud then i would anticipate that he would have knowledge of what he is in fear of and so i do not find it plausible that he would not know the details of this feud if he held such a genuine fear. also i note that even on his own evidence there has been no specific risk or threat made to him which would cause him to fear for his own safety beyond what is a more general tribal threat and of which he cannot provide much detail. ... 18. as i have found the appellant‚Äôs alleged reasoning for leaving iraq to not be credible then i also find that it is not plausible that his family have consequently threatened him as claimed due to his alleged desertion because of the alleged feud. instead i find that he has travelled to the uk with the assistance and knowledge of his family for reasons other than escaping a risk of persecution. as such i find that his family would therefore be able to assist him with obtaining a copy of his identification documents and csid which would help facilitate his return to iraq. i also find that he would be able to return to the help and support of his family there.‚Äù the judge dismissed the appellant‚Äôs appeal. 6. the appellant appeals to the upper tribunal on grounds dated 15 may 2019 which argue very briefly that the judge erred in law at paragraphs 15 to 20 by giving inadequate reasoning for finding the appellant‚Äôs account to not be credible and secondly that the judge had failed to apply relevant country guidance. 7. permission to appeal was granted by judge of the first-tier tribunal keane on 24 june 2019. the judge stated as follows: ‚Äúthe judge arguably had regard to irrelevant considerations in finding that the appellant had not given a credible account of events. the judge‚Äôs findings as to the credibility were to be found at paragraphs 15 to 18 inclusive of her decision. at paragraph 15 the judge attached weight so as to undermine the appellant‚Äôs credibility to a eurodac printout provided by the respondent which as the judge found proved that the appellant was photographed and printed in germany on 22 march 2016. the judge however did not explain why such circumstance damaged the appellant‚Äôs credibility. if the judge had in mind the appellant‚Äôs apparent failure to claim asylum in germany the judge arguably should have stated so. at paragraph 16 of the decision the judge again accorded weight to the eurodac document without stating why. at paragraph 17 of the decision the 3appeal number: pa/00240/2019 judge stated that the judge would have anticipated that the appellant would have had knowledge of the alleged feud which on his case caused him to leave his family and indeed his country. the judge arguably substituted her own understanding of what constituted reasonable conduct in circumstances where arguably she should not have done so. at paragraph 18 the judge stated that it was not plausible that the appellant‚Äôs family have consequently threatened him on account of his ostensible desertion and the judge was arguably disbelieving the appellant‚Äôs account without providing any or adequate reasons. it was incumbent on the judge in resolving the issue of credibility to embark upon a global assessment of the appellant‚Äôs credibility and to provide adequate reasons in support of a finding that he had not done so. this the judge arguably failed to do.‚Äù submissions 8. mr sharif relies upon the grounds of appeal and the admittedly more extensive grant of permission to appeal in support of his appellant‚Äôs case. 9. mr sharif points out that the only date given in the appellant‚Äôs account for any particular incident was in relation to the incident when the car in which the appellant was travelling had been shot at. the date for that is to be found in the sef interview at [86] and was simply ‚Äò2016‚Äô. the appellant gives no other dates for the matters that he relies upon in support of the proposition that he is at risk because of a blood feud in iraq. he does however consistently state that he left iraq in december 2017. mr sharif argues that the appellant had accepted in the course of his evidence that he had travelled through germany and therefore the evidence from the eurodac search confirming that did not alter the credibility of the appellant‚Äôs account. mr sharif also argued that the judge‚Äôs findings in relation to it being incredible that the appellant would not have had more knowledge about the details of the feud was an irrational finding on the part of the judge. 10. for his part mr mills defends the judge‚Äôs decision and argues that the dishonest statement that the appellant had remained in december 2017 was clearly capable of affecting the credibility of the appellant‚Äôs account. i raised with him whether or not such a discrepancy could be treated as determinative of the account given that there were no dates given in the appellant‚Äôs account of matters occurring in iraq any later than 22 march 2016. mr mills appeared to accept that it was right to say that the appellant‚Äôs credibility was not determinatively decided by the discrepancy of his whereabouts in march 2016. however mr mills points to the other findings at paragraph 17 in support of the judge‚Äôs reasoning. discussion 11. i find no material error of law in the judge‚Äôs decision. the suggestion in the grant of permission to appeal by judge keane that the judge had 4appeal number: pa/00240/2019 arguably had regard to irrelevant considerations is difficult to sustain. the appellant has clearly given inconsistent evidence about his whereabouts, on the one part insisting that he remained in iraq in december 2017 but incontrovertible evidence existing from the eurodac search result that he was present in germany on 22 march 2016. these two items of evidence simply cannot sit together. true it is that there are no details of the appellant‚Äôs account of any incidents that he has set out which are dated any later than 22 march 2016, and therefore being shot at in ‚Äò2016‚Äô and him departing iraq prior to 22 march 2016 does not necessarily make his account impossible to believe, but it is clearly a very significant matter that the appellant has lied about his continued presence in iraq up to the point of december 2017 and the judge was fully entitled to treat that as a very significant matter. whether or not she was entitled to treat it as rendering ‚Äòhis entire account unreliable‚Äô is moot. 12. however the judge does not stop there in her credibility findings because she continues, as is clear at paragraph 17, to set out other reasons for finding the appellant‚Äôs account incredible. whereas it may be expected that a young person may not be as fully informed about the details of a feud affecting his family and the wider tribe as might a fully-grown adult, the judge‚Äôs point is that the appellant decided, together with the assistance of a relative, to leave iraq because of this feud and the judge was entitled to find that it was implausible that the appellant knew so little about the feud whereas it had been the specific cause of his decision to leave the country. i find that it was not irrational for the judge to make the findings that she did at paragraph 17. there are a number of reasons therefore given by the judge for finding the appellant‚Äôs account incredible and i find that none of

guidance relevant to the issue of obtaining documents for readmission and residence in iraq. however in the light of my decision that the judge‚Äôs credibility findings are sustainable it is also sustainable that the appellant can have the assistance of family members in iraq to obtain any replacement documents that are needed to facilitate his return to, and residence in iraq. notice of

ha (anonymity direction made) appellant and the secretary of state for the home department respondent representation: for the appellant: mr j howard (solicitor) for the respondent: mr d mills (senior hopo) decision and reasons 1. this is an appeal against the determination of first-tier tribunal judge pacey, promulgated on 24 th june 2018, following a hearing at birmingham on 6 th june 2018. in the determination, the judge dismissed the appeal of the appellant, whereupon the appellant subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the upper tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me. the appellant ¬© crown copyright 2019appeal number: pa/05945/2018 2. the appellant is a male, a citizen of iran, and was born on 22 nd july 1996. he appealed against the decision of the respondent dated 24 th april 2018 refusing his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection pursuant to paragraph 339c of hc 395. the appellant‚Äôs claim 3. the essence of the appellant‚Äôs claim is that he is a member of a particular social group, because he is a gay iranian man who would face persecution if returned, and additionally he is also an atheist, who would be ill-treated upon return as a non-religious person, which is forbidden in iran. the judge‚Äôs findings 4. the judge noted how the appellant in his screening interview has said that he held no religion and that he would be subject to persecution as a non- religious person if returned to iran. he made no mention at that stage that he was also a gay person. during his asylum interview, however, he stated that he was a danger also because he was a homosexual and feared the government given that homosexuality was punishable by death. he had not mentioned this at his screening interview because he did not know anything about the country he was coming to. the appellant had then explained how he had a boyfriend in the uk by the name of [fs], with whom he had been in relationship for about one and a half months. he also had three serious relationships which he went on to describe in evidence before the tribunal. the judge did not find the appellant to be credible because the appellant‚Äôs explanation that he had not mentioned his homosexuality during his screening interview, because he did not know the country he was coming to, was not plausible. as the judge explained, ‚Äúif he did not know the uk approach to homosexuality ... he could not have known if the uk adopted as punitive an approach to gay people as did iran.... for all he knew he could have been travelling from the frying pan into the fire‚Äù (paragraph 68). 5. on the other hand, the judge observed that if the appellant was aware of the actual uk approach to homosexuality, ‚Äúthen there was no reason for him not to have mentioned his sexuality at the screening interview‚Äù (paragraph 69). 6. the judge was also not impressed by the witnesses before the tribunal. in short, the appellant‚Äôs claim was rejected wholesale. the appeal was dismissed. grounds of application 7. the grounds of application state that the judge had engaged in a material error of law in relation to the evidence of a miss [l] and that of mr [s] whose credibility had been wrongly impugned by the judge. there had been apparently a discrepancy between to the oral and the written 2appeal number: pa/05945/2018 evidence of miss [l], but this discrepancy had not been put to the witness, and if this was so then this was contrary to the rules of natural justice. 8. on 23 rd november 2018 permission to appeal was granted. submissions 9. at the hearing before me on 5 th july 2019, the appellant was represented by mr howard, who adopted the grounds of application. he submitted that if the judge was concerned about the discrepancy in the oral and written evidence of miss [l], then this should have been explored by the tribunal, because in her oral evidence, miss [l] had said that she had ‚Äúnot met [f]‚Äù, whereas in her written evidence she had said that ‚Äúshe also knew his previous partner, [f]‚Äù (paragraph 34). secondly, mr howard submitted that if one looks at the evidence of mr [s] (at page 14 of the appellant‚Äôs bundle). he makes it quite clear that he is the director of a voluntary organisation called persian lgbt advisory services, where it provides ‚Äúvoluntary social activities for lgbt asylum seekers‚Äù. he explains that the appellant had contacted him via facebook on 9 th june 2016. he invited the appellant to meet with him, and after a conversation he had come to the view that ‚Äúi am aware the appellant is openly active on facebook page which i would refer to as an online activist where he shares information on lgbt community using his facebook page...‚Äù. on that basis that the judge was wrong to have impugned his credibility. 10. for his part, mr mills submitted that the issues that were before the judge, both in relation to the appellant‚Äôs atheism and his homosexual tendencies, were not new issues. if evidence was collected by the appellant between the asylum interview and the tribunal hearing, in a manner that the appellant himself chose to do, then he should have been prepared to deal with it on the basis of oral testimony. these were not new points. the witnesses were not people whose evidence had previously been accepted. both cases were simply black and white discrepancy cases where the judge was entitled to say that she would not attach any significant weight to such evidence, because as put before the tribunal, the evidence was not persuasive. no error of law 11. i am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did not involve the making of an error on a point of law (see section 12(1) of tcea 2007) such that i should set aside the decision. my reasons are as follows. first, it is simply not correct to say that the discrepancy in the oral and witness statement evidence of miss [l] was something that the judge should have probed herself with a view to ascertaining exactly what miss [l] knew about mr [f]. the judge noted that in her oral evidence miss [l] stated she was aware that the appellant had a relationship in the uk ‚Äúbut had not met [f]‚Äù. then the judge noted how in her witness statement, miss [l] had stated that she became friends with the appellant when she met him in calais at the ‚Äúthe jungle‚Äù in april 2016, and ‚Äúwhen they became strong 3appeal number: pa/05945/2018 friends he told her of his fear of persecution and that he was an atheist. she also knew his previous partner, [f]‚Äù (paragraph 34). it was for the appellant‚Äôs representative to probe this matter further. as the evidence stood, the judge was entitled to conclude that ‚Äúmiss [l] has also been inconsistent in a written and oral account of whether she had met [f]‚Äù (paragraph 78). 12. second, as far as mr [s]‚Äôs evidence is concerned, i note that he is a director of the voluntary organisation called persian lgbt advisory services. he wrote in terms that he was ‚Äúaware the appellant is openly active on facebook page‚Äù. he had stated that ‚Äúi have acknowledged that the appellant has made a strong relationship with the wider lgbt communities ...‚Äù. he had further stated that ‚Äúi have also seen that the appellant has participated openly at this year‚Äôs lgbt pride with christian lgbt parade ...‚Äù. he ended his statement by declaring that ‚Äúbased on information that has been provided by the appellant i can confirm that he is homosexual and would be subject of persecution...‚Äù. (see page 14 of the appellant‚Äôs bundle). the manner in which the judge dealt with this evidence was one which was entirely open to her to do. what the judge states is that she would ‚Äúattach very little weight to mr [s]‚Äôs evidence‚Äù because ‚Äúhe said at the hearing that he had attended court since 2008 to support gay asylum seekers‚Äù. 13. nevertheless as the judge observed, ‚Äúhis support did not, on his own evidence, comprise independent verification of each appellant‚Äôs claim since he took the claim of each at face value, entirely taking their word for it without doing anything to verify their claim, in the way of what might be termed ‚Äòdue diligence‚Äô. while he may well be well-meaning, the uncritical nature of his support means it is of very little probative value‚Äù (paragraph 79). 14. there is nothing in this particular analysis of the judge‚Äôs detailed explanation that sits ill at ease with what the witness himself states in his statement of 4 th june 2018 (at page 14 of the appellant‚Äôs bundle) when he makes it clear that ‚Äúi am aware‚Äù or that ‚Äúi have acknowledged‚Äù. in any event, what the judge is referring to is actually what mr [s] himself said in his evidence where he makes it clear that as a director of the voluntary organisation he supports gay asylum seekers taking each claim at face value. accordingly, the decision of the judge in this particular case was clear, comprehensive, and well-reasoned and there is no error of law in it. decision 15. the decision of the first-tier tribunal did not involve the making of an error of law. the decision shall stand. 16. an anonymity order is made. 17. the appeal is dismissed. 4appeal number: pa/05945/2018 direction regarding anonymity ‚Äì rule 14 of the tribunal procedure (upper tribunal) rules 2008 unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity. no report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of their family. this direction applies both to the appellant and to the respondent. failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings. signed dated deputy upper tribunal judge juss 15 th august 2019 5'"

       "'Upper Tribunal  Immigration and Asylum Chamber  Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Birmingham CJC Decision & Reasons Promulgated On 21 November 2019 On 8 November 2019 Before DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE O‚ÄôRYAN Between MR D A  ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE  Appellant and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr Sharif, Fountain Solicitors For the Respondent: Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer DECISION AND REASONS 1. This is the Appellant‚Äôs appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Boylan-Kemp MBE dated 2 May 2019 dismissing the Appellant‚Äôs appeal against the Respondent‚Äôs decision of 23 November 2018 refusing his human rights and protection claim. ¬© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019 2. The Appellant is a national of Iraq of Kurdish origin and from Sulamaniyah in the IKR. He gave an account that he was at risk of serious harm in the IKR by reason of his family and extended tribe being in a feud with another tribe in the IKR. The Appellant was not able to give many details of the origins of the feud but stated that one family member had been killed as a result of it and that he himself had experienced two incidents; one being that unknown persons had fired upon a car in which he was travelling and his cousin had been injured in the shoulder, and another occasion when the house in which he lived was fired upon. 3. The Respondent in its decision refusing the protection claim disbelieved the Appellant‚Äôs account that there was any feud on the grounds that the Appellant knew very few details of the alleged feud. There was also said to be a discrepancy as between the Appellant‚Äôs evidence in interview as to how many occasions the Appellant experienced any problems himself  refusal letter, para [26]  and a discrepancy between an alleged fear of his own father  resulting from the Appellant refusing to take part in the feud  and information given in an age assessment interview in which he had stated that he had a good relationship with his family members  para [31] . 4. The Appellant appealed against that decision and the matter came before the judge at the Birmingham hearing centre on 18 March 2019. The Appellant was represented and gave evidence. At the date of that hearing the Appellant would have been 18 years of age. A further document was relied upon by the Respondent at that hearing, being a EURODAC search result, demonstrating that a person in the Appellant‚Äôs identity was fingerprinted in Dresden in Germany on 22 March 2016. The Appellant‚Äôs account as given in his SEF interview and confirmed in oral evidence before the judge was that he only left Iraq in December 2017. The Appellant denied before the judge that the person identified in the EURODAC search was him but the judge stated that she was satisfied by the details contained within the document, and looking at the clear photograph on the EURODAC match, that the person fingerprinted in Germany was indeed the Appellant. 5. The judge found at paragraph 14 onwards as follows: ‚Äú16. The evidence provided by the EURODAC document is unequivocal. The photograph contained within the document is clearly the Appellant who appeared before me and I have no reason to doubt that the document relates to him. Therefore this document upon which I am satisfied I can place significant weight puts him in Germany on 22 March 2016. Consequently I find that this evidence undermines the credibility of his entire account and his credibility as a witness in his own cause and that it renders his entire account unreliable. 2Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019 17. Further I also find his inability to recall the details of the alleged feud which caused him to leave his family and flee the country to also not be credible. If a young man was leaving his life behind because of his reluctance to become involved in an ongoing family feud then I would anticipate that he would have knowledge of what he is in fear of and so I do not find it plausible that he would not know the details of this feud if he held such a genuine fear. Also I note that even on his own evidence there has been no specific risk or threat made to him which would cause him to fear for his own safety beyond what is a more general tribal threat and of which he cannot provide much detail. ... 18. As I have found the Appellant‚Äôs alleged reasoning for leaving Iraq to not be credible then I also find that it is not plausible that his family have consequently threatened him as claimed due to his alleged desertion because of the alleged feud. Instead I find that he has travelled to the UK with the assistance and knowledge of his family for reasons other than escaping a risk of persecution. As such I find that his family would therefore be able to assist him with obtaining a copy of his identification documents and CSID which would help facilitate his return to Iraq. I also find that he would be able to return to the help and support of his family there.‚Äù The judge dismissed the Appellant‚Äôs appeal. 6. The Appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal on grounds dated 15 May 2019 which argue very briefly that the judge erred in law at paragraphs 15 to 20 by giving inadequate reasoning for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account to not be credible and secondly that the judge had failed to apply relevant country guidance. 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Keane on 24 June 2019. The judge stated as follows: ‚ÄúThe judge arguably had regard to irrelevant considerations in finding that the Appellant had not given a credible account of events. The judge‚Äôs findings as to the credibility were to be found at paragraphs 15 to 18 inclusive of her decision. At paragraph 15 the judge attached weight so as to undermine the Appellant‚Äôs credibility to a EURODAC printout provided by the Respondent which as the judge found proved that the Appellant was photographed and printed in Germany on 22 March 2016. The judge however did not explain why such circumstance damaged the Appellant‚Äôs credibility. If the judge had in mind the Appellant‚Äôs apparent failure to claim asylum in Germany the judge arguably should have stated so. At paragraph 16 of the decision the judge again accorded weight to the EURODAC document without stating why. At paragraph 17 of the decision the 3Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019 judge stated that the judge would have anticipated that the Appellant would have had knowledge of the alleged feud which on his case caused him to leave his family and indeed his country. The judge arguably substituted her own understanding of what constituted reasonable conduct in circumstances where arguably she should not have done so. At paragraph 18 the judge stated that it was not plausible that the Appellant‚Äôs family have consequently threatened him on account of his ostensible desertion and the judge was arguably disbelieving the Appellant‚Äôs account without providing any or adequate reasons. It was incumbent on the judge in resolving the issue of credibility to embark upon a global assessment of the Appellant‚Äôs credibility and to provide adequate reasons in support of a finding that he had not done so. This the judge arguably failed to do.‚Äù Submissions 8. Mr Sharif relies upon the grounds of appeal and the admittedly more extensive grant of permission to appeal in support of his Appellant‚Äôs case. 9. Mr Sharif points out that the only date given in the Appellant‚Äôs account for any particular incident was in relation to the incident when the car in which the Appellant was travelling had been shot at. The date for that is to be found in the SEF interview at [86] and was simply ‚Äò2016‚Äô. The Appellant gives no other dates for the matters that he relies upon in support of the proposition that he is at risk because of a blood feud in Iraq. He does however consistently state that he left Iraq in December 2017. Mr Sharif argues that the Appellant had accepted in the course of his evidence that he had travelled through Germany and therefore the evidence from the EURODAC search confirming that did not alter the credibility of the Appellant‚Äôs account. Mr Sharif also argued that the judge‚Äôs findings in relation to it being incredible that the Appellant would not have had more knowledge about the details of the feud was an irrational finding on the part of the judge. 10. For his part Mr Mills defends the judge‚Äôs decision and argues that the dishonest statement that the Appellant had remained in December 2017 was clearly capable of affecting the credibility of the Appellant‚Äôs account. I raised with him whether or not such a discrepancy could be treated as determinative of the account given that there were no dates given in the Appellant‚Äôs account of matters occurring in Iraq any later than 22 March 2016. Mr Mills appeared to accept that it was right to say that the Appellant‚Äôs credibility was not determinatively decided by the discrepancy of his whereabouts in March 2016. However Mr Mills points to the other findings at paragraph 17 in support of the judge‚Äôs reasoning. Discussion 11. I find no material error of law in the judge‚Äôs decision. The suggestion in the grant of permission to appeal by Judge Keane that the judge had 4Appeal Number: PA/00240/2019 arguably had regard to irrelevant considerations is difficult to sustain. The Appellant has clearly given inconsistent evidence about his whereabouts, on the one part insisting that he remained in Iraq in December 2017 but incontrovertible evidence existing from the EURODAC search result that he was present in Germany on 22 March 2016. These two items of evidence simply cannot sit together. True it is that there are no details of the Appellant‚Äôs account of any incidents that he has set out which are dated any later than 22 March 2016, and therefore being shot at in ‚Äò2016‚Äô and him departing Iraq prior to 22 March 2016 does not necessarily make his account impossible to believe, but it is clearly a very significant matter that the Appellant has lied about his continued presence in Iraq up to the point of December 2017 and the judge was fully entitled to treat that as a very significant matter. Whether or not she was entitled to treat it as rendering ‚Äòhis entire account unreliable‚Äô is moot. 12. However the judge does not stop there in her credibility findings because she continues, as is clear at paragraph 17, to set out other reasons for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account incredible. Whereas it may be expected that a young person may not be as fully informed about the details of a feud affecting his family and the wider tribe as might a fully-grown adult, the judge‚Äôs point is that the Appellant decided, together with the assistance of a relative, to leave Iraq because of this feud and the judge was entitled to find that it was implausible that the Appellant knew so little about the feud whereas it had been the specific cause of his decision to leave the country. I find that it was not irrational for the judge to make the findings that she did at paragraph 17. There are a number of reasons therefore given by the judge for finding the Appellant‚Äôs account incredible and I find that none of those reasons is vitiated by any error of law. 13. Judge Keane in granting permission did not comment upon the Appellant‚Äôs actual second ground which was that the judge had failed to apply country guidance relevant to the issue of obtaining documents for readmission and residence in Iraq. However in the light of my decision that the judge‚Äôs credibility findings are sustainable it is also sustainable that the Appellant can have the assistance of family members in Iraq to obtain any replacement documents that are needed to facilitate his return to, and residence in Iraq. Notice of Decision The judge‚Äôs decision did not involve the making of any material error of law. I do not set aside the decision. The Appellant‚Äôs appeal is dismissed.

Signed Date 20.11.19 Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge O‚ÄôRyan 6 Upper Tribunal  Immigration and Asylum Chamber  Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018 THE IMMIGRATION ACTS Heard at Birmingham CJC On 5 th July 2019 Decision & Reasons Promulgated On 19 th August 2019 Before DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE JUSS Between HA  ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE  Appellant and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT Respondent Representation: For the Appellant: Mr J Howard  Solicitor  For the Respondent: Mr D Mills  Senior HOPO  DECISION AND REASONS 1. This is an appeal against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pacey, promulgated on 24 th June 2018, following a hearing at Birmingham on 6 th June 2018. In the determination, the judge dismissed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Appellant subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me. The Appellant ¬© CROWN COPYRIGHT 2019Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Iran, and was born on 22 nd July 1996. He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated 24 th April 2018 refusing his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection pursuant to paragraph 339C of HC 395. The Appellant‚Äôs Claim 3. The essence of the Appellant‚Äôs claim is that he is a member of a particular social group, because he is a gay Iranian man who would face persecution if returned, and additionally he is also an atheist, who would be ill-treated upon return as a non-religious person, which is forbidden in Iran. The Judge‚Äôs Findings 4. The judge noted how the Appellant in his screening interview has said that he held no religion and that he would be subject to persecution as a non- religious person if returned to Iran. He made no mention at that stage that he was also a gay person. During his asylum interview, however, he stated that he was a danger also because he was a homosexual and feared the government given that homosexuality was punishable by death. He had not mentioned this at his screening interview because he did not know anything about the country he was coming to. The Appellant had then explained how he had a boyfriend in the UK by the name of [FS], with whom he had been in relationship for about one and a half months. He also had three serious relationships which he went on to describe in evidence before the Tribunal. The judge did not find the Appellant to be credible because the appellant‚Äôs explanation that he had not mentioned his homosexuality during his screening interview, because he did not know the country he was coming to, was not plausible. As the judge explained, ‚Äúif he did not know the UK approach to homosexuality ... he could not have known if the UK adopted as punitive an approach to gay people as did Iran.... For all he knew he could have been travelling from the frying pan into the fire‚Äù  paragraph 68 . 5. On the other hand, the judge observed that if the Appellant was aware of the actual UK approach to homosexuality, ‚Äúthen there was no reason for him not to have mentioned his sexuality at the screening interview‚Äù  paragraph 69 . 6. The judge was also not impressed by the witnesses before the Tribunal. In short, the Appellant‚Äôs claim was rejected wholesale. The appeal was dismissed. Grounds of Application 7. The grounds of application state that the judge had engaged in a material error of law in relation to the evidence of a Miss [L] and that of Mr [S] whose credibility had been wrongly impugned by the judge. There had been apparently a discrepancy between to the oral and the written 2Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018 evidence of Miss [L], but this discrepancy had not been put to the witness, and if this was so then this was contrary to the rules of natural justice. 8. On 23 rd November 2018 permission to appeal was granted. Submissions 9. At the hearing before me on 5 th July 2019, the Appellant was represented by Mr Howard, who adopted the grounds of application. He submitted that if the judge was concerned about the discrepancy in the oral and written evidence of Miss [L], then this should have been explored by the Tribunal, because in her oral evidence, Miss [L] had said that she had ‚Äúnot met [F]‚Äù, whereas in her written evidence she had said that ‚Äúshe also knew his previous partner, [F]‚Äù  paragraph 34 . Secondly, Mr Howard submitted that if one looks at the evidence of Mr [S]  at page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs bundle . He makes it quite clear that he is the director of a voluntary organisation called Persian LGBT Advisory Services, where it provides ‚Äúvoluntary social activities for LGBT asylum seekers‚Äù. He explains that the appellant had contacted him via Facebook on 9 th June 2016. He invited the Appellant to meet with him, and after a conversation he had come to the view that ‚ÄúI am aware the Appellant is openly active on Facebook page which I would refer to as an online activist where he shares information on LGBT community using his Facebook page...‚Äù. On that basis that the judge was wrong to have impugned his credibility. 10. For his part, Mr Mills submitted that the issues that were before the judge, both in relation to the Appellant‚Äôs atheism and his homosexual tendencies, were not new issues. If evidence was collected by the Appellant between the asylum interview and the Tribunal hearing, in a manner that the Appellant himself chose to do, then he should have been prepared to deal with it on the basis of oral testimony. These were not new points. The witnesses were not people whose evidence had previously been accepted. Both cases were simply black and white discrepancy cases where the judge was entitled to say that she would not attach any significant weight to such evidence, because as put before the Tribunal, the evidence was not persuasive. No Error of Law 11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did not involve the making of an error on a point of law  see Section 12 1  of TCEA 2007  such that I should set aside the decision. My reasons are as follows. First, it is simply not correct to say that the discrepancy in the oral and witness statement evidence of Miss [L] was something that the judge should have probed herself with a view to ascertaining exactly what Miss [L] knew about Mr [F]. The judge noted that in her oral evidence Miss [L] stated she was aware that the Appellant had a relationship in the UK ‚Äúbut had not met [F]‚Äù. Then the judge noted how in her witness statement, Miss [L] had stated that she became friends with the Appellant when she met him in Calais at the ‚Äúthe jungle‚Äù in April 2016, and ‚Äúwhen they became strong 3Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018 friends he told her of his fear of persecution and that he was an atheist. She also knew his previous partner, [F]‚Äù  paragraph 34 . It was for the Appellant‚Äôs representative to probe this matter further. As the evidence stood, the judge was entitled to conclude that ‚ÄúMiss [L] has also been inconsistent in a written and oral account of whether she had met [F]‚Äù  paragraph 78 . 12. Second, as far as Mr [S]‚Äôs evidence is concerned, I note that he is a director of the voluntary organisation called Persian LGBT Advisory Services. He wrote in terms that he was ‚Äúaware the Appellant is openly active on Facebook page‚Äù. He had stated that ‚ÄúI have acknowledged that the Appellant has made a strong relationship with the wider LGBT communities ...‚Äù. He had further stated that ‚ÄúI have also seen that the Appellant has participated openly at this year‚Äôs LGBT Pride with Christian LGBT parade ...‚Äù. He ended his statement by declaring that ‚Äúbased on information that has been provided by the Appellant I can confirm that he is homosexual and would be subject of persecution...‚Äù.  See page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs bundle . The manner in which the judge dealt with this evidence was one which was entirely open to her to do. What the judge states is that she would ‚Äúattach very little weight to Mr [S]‚Äôs evidence‚Äù because ‚Äúhe said at the hearing that he had attended court since 2008 to support gay asylum seekers‚Äù. 13. Nevertheless as the judge observed, ‚Äúhis support did not, on his own evidence, comprise independent verification of each Appellant‚Äôs claim since he took the claim of each at face value, entirely taking their word for it without doing anything to verify their claim, in the way of what might be termed ‚Äòdue diligence‚Äô. While he may well be well-meaning, the uncritical nature of his support means it is of very little probative value‚Äù  paragraph 79 . 14. There is nothing in this particular analysis of the judge‚Äôs detailed explanation that sits ill at ease with what the witness himself states in his statement of 4 th June 2018  at page 14 of the Appellant‚Äôs bundle  when he makes it clear that ‚ÄúI am aware‚Äù or that ‚ÄúI have acknowledged‚Äù. In any event, what the judge is referring to is actually what Mr [S] himself said in his evidence where he makes it clear that as a director of the voluntary organisation he supports gay asylum seekers taking each claim at face value. Accordingly, the decision of the judge in this particular case was clear, comprehensive, and well-reasoned and there is no error of law in it. Decision 15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error of law. The decision shall stand. 16. An anonymity order is made. 17. The appeal is dismissed. 4Appeal Number: PA/05945/2018 Direction Regarding Anonymity ‚Äì Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  Upper Tribunal  Rules 2008 Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member of their family. This direction applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent.
